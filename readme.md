## About

Python is a general-purpose programming language widely used in data science, web applications, and scripting to automate common tasks. In this hands-on Introduction to Python workshop, participants will begin learning Python through a brief analysis and visualization of tabular data. While we won't be doing a deep dive into Python syntax, this experience with Python will help participants develop a sense of the language's features and how it might be used in their work.

## Learning goals

The goal of this workshop is to learn about Python and what you can do with it through writing code together to achieve a common task: analyzing tabular data. The goal _is not_ to develop mastery, or even get a solid introduction to the language's syntax and patterns. It is to have a hands-on experience doing something practical while learning more about the language.

## Data source

In the workshop, we'll analyze data about public libraries in North Carolina from the State Library of North Carolina (SLNC). I've uploaded a copy of the data to Github for ease of use in this workshop, since SLNC doesn't directly expose a link to the raw data.

You can find the original data [here](https://statelibrary.ncdcr.gov/fy20-statistical-report-north-carolina-libraries-draft).

## Writing and running the workshop code

During the workshop, we'll be writing and running Python code together in a cloud environment. I'll be live coding, with you writing the same code I'm writing on screen. A copy of the workshop materials, with all of the code and materials, is in the Github repository. Rather than trying to follow my screen, you can pull up those materials as your reference while you type your code.

If you would prefer not to write code, but just run the code as I've already typed it, you can click one of the links below to pull up the fully written materials in a code environment.
