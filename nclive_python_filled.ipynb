They're quickly becoming a standard way of putting together data, code, and written explanations or visualizations into a single document and sharing that. There are a lot of ways that you can run Jupyter notebooks, including just locally on your computer, but we've decided to use Google's Colaboratory notebook platform for this workshop.  Colaboratory is “a Google research project created to help disseminate machine learning education and research.”  If you would like to know more about Colaboratory in general, you can visit the [Welcome Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).\n",
